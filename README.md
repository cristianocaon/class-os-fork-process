# System Programming and Process Management (C)

Project for Operating System class at Texas Tech University, with professor Dr. Yong Chen.

The Makefile contains the configuration to compile the C programs. The source codes hello_child.c and hello_child2.c contain the different types of child process creation required for the exercise. The file hello_child.c is for the requirements 1-4. The file hello_child2.c is for requirement 5. The script.sh file contain the UNIX commands necessary to compile the C code from the previous mentioned source codes, passing along the inputs 2, 4, and 8 as requested.

To run the programs, just invoke the script by typing ./script.sh in the command line.
